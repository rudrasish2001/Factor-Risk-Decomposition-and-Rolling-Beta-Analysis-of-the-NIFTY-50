# Factor-Risk-Decomposition-and-Rolling-Beta-Analysis-of-the-NIFTY-50
This project examines the NIFTY 50 using multi-factor models, rolling betas, and factor contribution analysis. It highlights how market, size, value, and other factors influence returns over time, reveals shifts in systematic risk across market cycles, and provides a clear decomposition of the index’s key return drivers.
